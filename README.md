# Project-2
# Dungeons & Dragons:
Created by Lucas Aho, Alex Hampton, and Nicole Heersink

## Purpose behind the app:

To give Dungeons & Dragons  Dungeon Masters and Players a place to create their own characters, manage their NPCs, navigate the location around the party’s campaign and communicate with the party.

## functionality:

When a user navigates to the Dungeons & Dragons application they will be asked to either login or if they do not already have an existing account they can create one. When creating a user account they will be asked to identify as either a dungeon master or a player. These identifiers will direct the user to the appropriate page.

### Dungeon Master's Page:

On the Dungeon Master’s page the dungeon master can create new NPCs (nonplayer characters) by selecting the New NPC button and entering in the required descriptions for the character or search for NPCs from dnd5e library. Once all the descriptions are submitted the DM only needs to click the Create button and the new NPC will be displayed in the Created Content.  The Dungeon Master can also create locations by following simpular steps as creatig the NPC but by clicking on the New Location button instead. Lastly, the Dungeon Master can communicate with the party players through chat.
